                <b> <a href="about.html">Humans (Homo sapiens)</a></b> are a species of highly intelligent primates.
                They
                are
                the only extant members of
                the subtribe Hominina and—together with chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans—are part of the family
                Hominidae
                (the great apes, or hominids). Humans are terrestrial animals, characterized by their erect posture and
                bipedal
                locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex
                language
                use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other primates; and highly
                advanced and organized societies.

            <p>
                The genus <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human#Evolution">Homo</a></i> evolved and diverged
                from
                other hominins in Africa several million years ago, after the
                human clade split from the chimpanzee lineage of the hominids (great apes) branch of the primates.
                Modern
                humans, specifically the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, proceeded to colonize all the continents and
                larger
                islands, arriving in Eurasia <sub><b>125,000–60,000</b></sub> years ago, Australia around
                <sub><b>40,000</b></sub> years ago, the Americas
                around <sub><b>15,000</b></sub> years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar,
                and
                New
                Zealand between
                the years 300 and 1280.<sup>[29][30]</sup>
            </p>

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                The human body's ability to adapt to different environmental stresses allows humans to acclimatize to a
                wide
                variety of temperatures, humidity, and altitudes. As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found
                in
                almost
                all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and
                heavily
                polluted cities. Most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited
                adaptability.
                The human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface, because the
                population
                density varies from one region to another and there are large areas almost completely uninhabited, like
                Antarctica. Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%),
                Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).<sup>[92]</sup>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                As early Homo sapiens dispersed, it encountered varieties of archaic humans both in Africa and in
                Eurasia,
                in
                Eurasia notably Homo neanderthalensis. Since 2010, evidence for gene flow between archaic and modern
                humans
                during the period of roughly 100,000 to 30,000 years ago has been discovered. This includes modern human
                admixture in Neanderthals, Neanderthal admixture in all modern humans outside Africa, Denisova hominin
                admixture in Melanesians as well as admixture from unnamed archaic humans to some Sub-Saharan African
                populations.
